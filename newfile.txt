What is the difference between add, commit, and push?

 - Based on my own understanding, git add is the process of staging files that has recent changes or updates and 
 also to track files that are newly added to our current working directory.
 After staging the files using git add, the next step will be the git commit command where in 
 we make the staged commits in our local repository ready for pushing to the remote repository, we also add commit message
 in this process for proper tracking of changes. Then the next step will be git push, one of the most important steps of git, 
 the process wherein all the comitted changes will now be sent and update our remote repository.
